# MBTAWiki App

## Description
The MBTA Wiki app allows users to track when trains and buses will arrive to better plan for their travel. The app provides live updates on trains, trolleys, buses, and commuter rail trains with an intuitive and eye-pleasing user interface. Features include opening stations in the Maps app, viewing upcoming predictions, and viewing different route variations for each of the transit lines.

## Update 0.1.0
First upload to the Apple app store! This first version provides the basic features. In the future, I hope to add more features, which will be published in future updates.
